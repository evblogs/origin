#  {.wp-block-heading}

When we talk about electric mobility in India, the spotlight usually shines on big players like Tata Power, ChargeZone, and Ather Grid. But every now and then, a local company rises from the grassroots, not only to compete with these giants but to offer solutions that truly understand the pulse of the region. One such name that’s steadily gaining recognition across South India — particularly in Tamil Nadu — is **Relux Electric**.

From its humble beginnings to becoming one of the fastest-growing EV charging infrastructure providers in South India, Relux Electric is a story worth telling. It’s not just about EV charging. It’s about empowerment, decentralization, and reshaping how people travel across towns, highways, and cities in Tamil Nadu.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## From a Regional Idea to a Statewide Movement {.wp-block-heading}

Relux Electric wasn’t founded in the boardrooms of metropolitan cities. It was born in Tamil Nadu — a state with a proud tradition of embracing technology, sustainable practices, and homegrown entrepreneurship. The founding team, made up of engineers and infrastructure experts, noticed a pattern that others ignored — **EV adoption was growing not just in cities like Chennai and Coimbatore but also in towns like Madurai, Salem, and Tirunelveli.**

Yet, these areas had little to no public EV infrastructure. No chargers at rest stops, no apps to locate charging points, no roadside help if a battery drained mid-journey. That’s where Relux came in.

From day one, their goal was clear: **Make EV charging available and affordable across all of Tamil Nadu, especially in places where others wouldn’t bother going.**

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Understanding the Relux Approach {.wp-block-heading}

Most EV charging startups have focused on big-ticket partnerships, glitzy locations, and metro cities. Relux did the opposite. They focused on:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Partnering with <strong>local petrol bunks, community halls, schools, colleges, and small hotels</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Building chargers in <strong>semi-urban and rural districts</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Offering <strong>Tamil-language customer support</strong> and an app interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Training local electricians and workers to <strong>install and service stations</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

This approach didn’t just help Relux scale quickly — it built trust. A trust that’s visible today in the number of EV drivers who swear by their services in towns where no other charger exists.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Charging Infrastructure: How Big Is Relux’s Network? {.wp-block-heading}

As of 2025, Relux operates **over 150 electric vehicle charging stations** across Tamil Nadu and has begun expanding into neighboring states like Karnataka and Kerala. Their presence spans:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Highways:</strong> You’ll find Relux chargers on NH-44, NH-32, NH-79, and other major roadways.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cities and Towns:</strong> Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy, Erode, Salem, Nagercoil, Vellore, and over 30 Tier-2/3 towns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strategic Public Spaces:</strong> Railway stations, tourist spots, shopping centers, and religious pilgrimage centers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apartments and Commercial Buildings:</strong> Installation services are offered through B2B partnerships.
  </li>
</ul>

They provide both **fast and slow chargers** including AC chargers (3.3kW–7.2kW) and DC fast chargers (15kW–60kW). These cater to two-wheelers, e-rickshaws, passenger EVs, and even electric buses.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Relux’s Product Ecosystem: Not Just Chargers {.wp-block-heading}

Relux has quietly built a solid product and service ecosystem that supports end-to-end EV adoption.

### Public electric vehicle Charging Stations {.wp-block-heading}

Their primary offering remains well-positioned electric vehicle charging stations. Each station has 2 to 6 chargers and includes:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Dual connectors to support different car types
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety features for surge protection
  </li>
  <li>
    Real-time monitoring and remote diagnosis
  </li>
  <li>
    On-ground service teams in every district
  </li>
</ul>

### Residential and Fleet Charging {.wp-block-heading}

Relux offers charger installation at homes and fleet depots. This includes:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Site inspection
  </li>
  <li>
    Electrical load assessment
  </li>
  <li>
    Installation by trained technicians
  </li>
  <li>
    AMC (Annual Maintenance Contracts)
  </li>
</ul>

### EV Charging App {.wp-block-heading}

Their app (available on both Android and iOS) allows users to:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Locate nearby chargers
  </li>
  <li>
    View real-time status of each charging point
  </li>
  <li>
    Reserve a slot
  </li>
  <li>
    Pay via UPI, debit/credit card, wallets
  </li>
  <li>
    Access user history and reports
  </li>
</ul>

The app is available in **English and Tamil**, catering directly to the state’s core population.

### Solar Hybrid Stations {.wp-block-heading}

Some of Relux’s newer stations integrate solar energy, especially in towns that face frequent power cuts. This reduces operational costs and promotes green energy at the source.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Strategic Expansion and Partnerships {.wp-block-heading}

Relux didn’t scale on its own. It formed partnerships that made expansion smoother and smarter.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Petrol Pump Alliances</strong>: Agreements with Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil retailers allowed them to install chargers at pump locations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Real Estate Developers</strong>: Tie-ups with gated communities and apartment complexes brought in residential users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tamil Nadu Transport Corporation</strong>: Pilot charging infrastructure for electric buses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Educational Institutions</strong>: Installed EV chargers in over 50 colleges and universities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tourist Boards</strong>: Chargers deployed at hill stations, beach resorts, and pilgrimage destinations like Rameswaram and Kanchipuram.
  </li>
</ul>

Their success also owes a lot to the Tamil Nadu state EV policy, which offers subsidies, single-window approvals, and incentives for green infrastructure. Relux took full advantage of these schemes, especially to set up in smaller municipalities and panchayats.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Unique Features That Make Relux Stand Out {.wp-block-heading}

Unlike national players that try to apply a one-size-fits-all strategy, Relux customizes its approach based on the locality:

<ol class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Tamil-First Customer Service</strong><br />Every call center employee speaks fluent Tamil and understands regional dialects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Price-Per-Minute Charging</strong><br />Instead of per-kWh, many Relux stations use a time-based model to simplify pricing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Franchisee Model</strong><br />Local entrepreneurs can run their own Relux station under guidance — helping create jobs and grow income in Tier-3 towns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mobile Charging Vans</strong><br />Introduced in Coimbatore, these EV vans help stranded vehicles on highways. They’re equipped with 15kWh battery packs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Educational Drives</strong><br />Relux frequently hosts community EV awareness programs in temples, schools, and panchayats.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Real Impact on the Ground: Customer Testimonials {.wp-block-heading}

### Case 1: A Solo Trip Across Tamil Nadu {.wp-block-heading}

Arun Prasad, a travel vlogger from Chennai, completed a 900 km round trip covering Pondicherry, Thanjavur, Kodaikanal, and Dindigul — charging only at Relux stations. His review?

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    “I didn’t think a local company could give me such peace of mind. The stations were clean, well-lit, and working every time I reached. That’s all I need.”
  </p>
</blockquote>

### Case 2: Women’s Self-Help Group in Karur {.wp-block-heading}

A group of women running an e-rickshaw service now saves over ₹7,000/month by charging at Relux’s subsidised EV station near the textile market.

### Case 3: College Campus Charging in Namakkal {.wp-block-heading}

A private college installed a Relux 7.2kW charger in its parking lot. Now faculty and students use it daily — building a new generation of EV users.

Where Relux wins is in **hyper-localization, grassroots awareness, and reliability**. Many EV owners report fewer failures and better uptime on Relux stations compared to competitors.

## Final Thoughts: Relux Is the EV Backbone South India Deserves {.wp-block-heading}

The electric revolution in India is happening — but not evenly. While metro cities enjoy the benefits of early infrastructure and investment, towns and highways are often left behind.

Relux Electric is bridging that gap. Not with billion-dollar backing or flashy PR campaigns, but with simple, meaningful work rooted in **Tamil Nadu’s communities, values, and needs**.

Whether you’re riding a two-wheeler in Karur, driving a Nexon EV from Salem to Trichy, or planning a road trip from Madurai to Kanyakumari — chances are, a Relux charger is part of your journey.

That’s what makes them a hero — **quiet, committed, and always moving forward.**
