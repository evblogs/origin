## Real-Life Example of Charging {.wp-block-heading}

Imagine you are driving from Bangalore to Chennai in your Nexon EV.  
You use the Statiq app to book a fast charger in Vellore. While your EV charges, you take a 30-minute snack break. Once done, your car is ready with 80% charge, and you can easily complete the journey.

This kind of seamless travel experience is becoming common across major highways.
