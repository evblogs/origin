### Introduction: Why Build Your Own Electric Bike? {.wp-block-heading}

The electric bike (e-bike) revolution is happening across India. Whether it’s delivery partners in cities, college students riding to class, or tech-savvy commuters avoiding petrol bills—everyone is exploring electric two-wheelers. But buying a new e-bike can be expensive.

As a college student, imagine taking an old cycle or a lightweight petrol moped and converting it into a fully functioning electric bike. Not only is it budget-friendly, but it’s also a fantastic hands-on learning project that teaches you real engineering skills: wiring, battery systems, motor control, energy optimization, and more.

This guide will help you plan, build, test, and showcase your electric bike conversion project using locally available components—all with a student budget and a practical, India-ready mindset.

  </li>
  <li>
    Great for college expos, final-year engineering projects, or startup ideas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Helps understand India’s booming electric mobility sector.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ideal for city, rural, and even campus-only usage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combines mechanical, electrical, electronics, and programming skills.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### Start With a Clear Use Case {.wp-block-heading}

Before you build, decide how and where the bike will be used:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Campus rides (short distances, low load)
  </li>
  <li>
    Urban commuting (traffic handling, range optimization)
  </li>
  <li>
    Rural roads (shock absorbers, extra load)
  </li>
  <li>
    Last-mile delivery (cargo box at rear)
  </li>
</ul>

Your use case will help you select the right motor, battery, frame, and features.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### Choosing the Right Donor Bike {.wp-block-heading}

Start with a strong, lightweight, and rust-free cycle or moped. Your options:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Mountain Bike (MTB)</strong>: Good for rough terrain and budget builds.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Road/Hybrid Cycle</strong>: Best for speed and smooth rides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Old Moped (like Luna or TVS XL)</strong>: Sturdier frame and larger tires.
  </li>
</ul>

Make sure the frame has:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Space for battery mounting (under seat or inside triangle)
  </li>
  <li>
    Enough strength to handle motor torque and battery weight
  </li>
  <li>
    Strong fork and rear stays to handle hub motor
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### Motor Selection: Hub or Mid-Drive? {.wp-block-heading}

You’ll choose between two main motor types:

#### 1. **Hub Motor (Rear or Front Wheel)** {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Easy to install
  </li>
  <li>
    Less complicated wiring
  </li>
  <li>
    Best for flat terrains and city rides
  </li>
</ul>

#### 2. **Mid-Drive Motor (Crank Area)** {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Better weight distribution
  </li>
  <li>
    Uses existing gears—good for hilly areas
  </li>
  <li>
    Slightly more complex installation
  </li>
</ul>

For student projects, **rear hub motors (250W to 500W)** are affordable and effective.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### Battery Selection: Powering Your Ride {.wp-block-heading}

The battery is your fuel tank. Choose based on your required range and weight handling.

#### Popular Battery Options: {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>36V 10Ah</strong>: Range ~25–35 km; compact, lightweight
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>48V 15Ah</strong>: Range ~50–60 km; heavier but higher performance
  </li>
</ul>

**Lithium-ion** batteries are recommended over lead-acid. Look for:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Integrated BMS (Battery Management System)
  </li>
  <li>
    Waterproof casing
  </li>
  <li>
    Brackets for mounting
  </li>
</ul>
