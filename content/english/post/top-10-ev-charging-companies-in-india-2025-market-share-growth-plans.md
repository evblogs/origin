## Introduction {.wp-block-heading}

<p class="has-text-align-left">
  India&#8217;s electric vehicle (EV) landscape is rapidly evolving, with significant strides in both adoption and infrastructure development. As the nation accelerates towards a greener future, understanding the current state of EV charging infrastructure and the key players driving this transformation becomes essential.

## Current State of EV Charging Infrastructure in India {.wp-block-heading}

### Rapid Growth in electric vehicle Charging Stations {.wp-block-heading}

India has witnessed a substantial increase in public electric vehicle charging stations. According to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, as of April 2025, there are over 26,367 public electric vehicle charging stations across Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 cities, up from 11,903 at the end of 2023.

### Urban vs. Rural Deployment {.wp-block-heading}

While metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore have seen significant infrastructure development, rural regions are gradually catching up. The Delhi government, for instance, has implemented a revamped EV policy aiming to create 20,000 jobs through the expansion of charging and battery-swapping infrastructure. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/revamped-ev-policy-hopes-to-create-20000-jobs-in-delhi-with-expanded-charging-network/articleshow/121038038.cms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times of India</a>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Government Policies and Incentives {.wp-block-heading}

### FAME II Scheme {.wp-block-heading}

The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME II) scheme has been instrumental in promoting EV adoption. Under this scheme, the Ministry of Heavy Industries has sanctioned ₹800 crore to state-run oil marketing companies for establishing 7,432 public electric vehicle charging stations.

### PM E-DRIVE Scheme {.wp-block-heading}

Launched in October 2024, the Prime Minister Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme allocated ₹2,000 crore for charging infrastructure development, aiming to support 22,100 EV chargers for electric four-wheeled vehicles through March 2026.

## Types of electric vehicle Charging Stations {.wp-block-heading}

### AC Charging {.wp-block-heading}

Alternating current (AC) chargers are commonly used for home and workplace charging. They are cost-effective but offer slower charging speeds, typically taking 6-8 hours for a full charge.

### DC Fast Charging {.wp-block-heading}

Direct Current (DC) fast chargers provide rapid charging solutions, ideal for public electric vehicle charging stations. They can charge an EV up to 80% in approximately 60 minutes, making them suitable for long-distance travel.

### Battery Swapping Stations {.wp-block-heading}

Battery swapping allows for quick replacement of depleted batteries, reducing downtime. This method is gaining traction, especially for commercial vehicles and two-wheelers.
