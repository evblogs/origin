As India moves rapidly toward a greener mobility future, the electric vehicle (EV) charging ecosystem is becoming the bedrock of this transition. One of the most ambitious players entering this space is **Jio-bp Pulse** — the EV charging business born from a powerful joint venture between Reliance Industries Limited and British Petroleum (BP). Though a relatively new entrant, Jio-bp Pulse has already made bold moves to shape the EV charging landscape in India through strategic placement, ultra-fast charging, renewable integration, and extensive collaborations.

In this detailed blog, we’ll explore the full history of Jio-bp Pulse, how it has evolved since its inception, what it currently offers to both EV drivers and business partners, and its aggressive roadmap for the future. This is not just another EV brand—it’s a sign of how India’s largest corporate players are betting big on electric mobility.

## How It All Began: The Genesis of Jio-bp Pulse {.wp-block-heading}

Jio-bp Pulse was officially launched in 2021 as part of the larger Reliance-BP joint venture under Reliance BP Mobility Limited (RBML). The company aimed to combine BP’s global EV charging experience (such as the BP Pulse network in the UK) with Reliance’s expansive fuel station footprint and real estate reach in India.

This wasn’t just about launching chargers. It was about reimagining fuel retail in India. Jio-bp Pulse envisioned India’s existing petrol pumps transforming into **multi-energy hubs** — offering petrol, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and electric vehicle charging under one roof.

The first few EV chargers appeared quietly at existing Jio-bp fuel stations, especially in Maharashtra and Delhi-NCR. But soon after, the company launched its **Pulse brand** to signal a focused EV initiative. By 2022, Jio-bp Pulse had rolled out dozens of chargers, forming a base for what would later scale exponentially.

## The 2024–2025 Growth Phase: Building Nationwide Momentum {.wp-block-heading}

Fast forward to 2024, Jio-bp Pulse reported it had crossed the **5,000 charger milestone** — covering over **500 charging stations** in key urban and transit locations. Many of these were installed at or near Jio-bp mobility stations (Reliance fuel stations), and several others were deployed through **commercial tie-ups with malls, residential developers, fleet operators, and metro rail stations**.

What differentiated Jio-bp Pulse in this period was its focus on:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>High-speed DC chargers</strong> (30–60 kW and more)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Charging stations along EV corridors</strong> (Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, Mumbai-Pune, Bengaluru-Hyderabad)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>App-enabled, digitally managed infrastructure</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Co-located retail services</strong> like cafes and convenience stores
  </li>
</ul>

The Pulse network quickly grew in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, and Chennai. Users started to recognize the **green-and-black Pulse branding** as a sign of a reliable, well-lit, secure, and fast EV charging option.

## What Jio-bp Pulse Offers Today (2025) {.wp-block-heading}

### 1. A Multi-Tiered Charging Infrastructure {.wp-block-heading}

Jio-bp Pulse offers three major types of chargers:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>AC Chargers</strong> (3.3 kW–7.4 kW): Best for two-wheelers, e-autos, or long parking sessions
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DC Fast Chargers</strong> (30–60 kW): Ideal for passenger EVs like the Tata Nexon EV, MG ZS EV, or BYD Atto 3
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ultra-Fast DC Chargers</strong> (100–480 kW): For long-range premium EVs, fleet operators, and upcoming commercial EVs
  </li>
</ul>

These are spread across fuel stations, commercial buildings, parking lots, highways, and business parks. Most stations support **CCS2 connectors**, which are standard for Indian EVs, along with **Type 2 AC plugs** for slower charging.

### 2. App Ecosystem and RFID Access {.wp-block-heading}

The **Jio-bp Pulse App** lets users:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Find the nearest charger
  </li>
  <li>
    Check availability in real-time
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to the station
  </li>
  <li>
    Start and stop charging
  </li>
  <li>
    Pay through UPI, cards, wallets, or Pulse subscriptions
  </li>
</ul>

The company also offers **RFID cards** for fleet and private users who prefer a tap-to-charge option. Some larger fleet users (like BluSmart and e-commerce delivery companies) have dedicated Pulse fleet accounts to manage billing, usage, and access.

### 3. Battery Swapping Pilots {.wp-block-heading}

For electric two- and three-wheelers, Jio-bp Pulse has started pilot programs with **battery swapping infrastructure** in Mumbai and Hyderabad. The idea is simple: instead of waiting 1–2 hours for a charge, just swap the depleted battery with a fully charged one in under 2 minutes. This model especially appeals to delivery riders, gig workers, and autorickshaw fleets.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Strategic Collaborations and Commercial Partnerships {.wp-block-heading}

One reason for the rapid scale of Jio-bp Pulse is its well-planned partnerships:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>BluSmart Mobility</strong>: Jio-bp has built dedicated charging hubs for BluSmart, India’s all-electric ride-hailing service, across Delhi-NCR and Mumbai.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>House of Hiranandani</strong>: EV chargers in premium residential townships in Chennai, Bengaluru, and Mumbai.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Piramal Realty</strong>: Providing residential and commercial EV charging integration in upcoming developments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)</strong>: Chargers installed at metro stations like Rithala and Rajiv Chowk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apollo Tyres and Mahindra Logistics</strong>: Fleet charging partnerships at warehouses and last-mile hubs.
  </li>
</ul>

These alliances help Jio-bp Pulse serve not just individual drivers, but also large mobility players looking to electrify their operations.
