### **Scene 1: Monday Morning Reality Check** {.wp-block-heading}

It’s Monday morning, and you&#8217;re stuck once again in a chaotic jam on Delhi’s infamous ring road. Petrol fumes waft around, cars honk impatiently, and your fuel needle dangerously flirts with &#8220;Empty.&#8221;

_&#8220;Not again! Didn&#8217;t I just spend ₹6,000 on fuel this week?&#8221;_ you mutter, frustrated.

You glance aside. A futuristic, sleek car silently glides past—effortlessly, quietly, no fumes, no drama.

_&#8220;Must be expensive,&#8221;_ you think aloud.

Your co-passenger nudges you and whispers with a grin, “It costs less than your petrol bills! That&#8217;s an EV—fully electric and under ₹10 lakh!”

You’re intrigued. “Affordable EVs under ₹10 lakh? Really?”

_[Cue dramatic music, scene transitions.]_
