India&#8217;s transition to electric mobility is not just about reducing carbon emissions — it’s a strategic move to curb fuel imports, improve air quality, and become a global leader in EV technology. To make this happen, the Government of India has rolled out several **electric vehicle policies** that provide financial incentives, tax benefits, infrastructure support, and ease of doing business for EV manufacturers, fleet operators, charging companies, and startups.

If you&#8217;re planning to enter the EV industry — whether it&#8217;s two-wheelers, charging stations, battery swapping, or electric logistics — understanding these government initiatives can help you plan and grow faster.

Let’s break it down in simple terms.
