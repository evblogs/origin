India is charging full speed into the electric vehicle (EV) era, and if there&#8217;s one government initiative that’s transforming the industry from the inside out, it’s the **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme**. Designed to promote large-scale domestic manufacturing, this policy isn’t just about subsidies. It’s about building a self-reliant, export-ready EV ecosystem that can compete with the world.

In this detailed guide, we’ll unpack everything you need to know about the **PLI Scheme for the EV sector**, including how to apply, eligibility criteria, incentive calculations, current beneficiaries, and the opportunities it opens up for startups, OEMs, and component makers in India.

Let’s break it down step-by-step so that you can confidently understand—and benefit from—this ambitious policy framework.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## What is the PLI Scheme? {.wp-block-heading}

The **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme** is a performance-based government initiative that rewards businesses for increasing their manufacturing output within India. Rather than giving upfront subsidies, it offers **cash incentives** tied to actual sales and production volume over a set period (usually 5 years).

Think of it this way: if you manufacture more and meet localization targets, you get a percentage of your sales back as a government incentive.

In the EV space, the government has introduced two major PLI schemes:

<ol class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>PLI for Automobile and Auto Components</strong> – Focused on electric vehicles and related components
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage</strong> – Focused on domestic battery cell manufacturing
  </li>
</ol>

Both these schemes work in synergy with FAME-II, NEMMP, and various state EV policies to push India towards a cleaner, self-sufficient transport future.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Why the EV Sector Was Chosen for PLI {.wp-block-heading}

India imports a large chunk of its vehicle components and almost all of its battery cells. This dependence on foreign countries—especially for advanced lithium-ion technology—has been a strategic concern.

Here’s why the EV sector is central to PLI:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Reduce import dependency</strong> on China, Korea, and Japan
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encourage Make in India</strong> for critical components like motors, controllers, and battery packs
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lower costs</strong> of EVs by localizing the supply chain
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create jobs</strong> in EV design, manufacturing, and R&D
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Establish India as a global EV export hub</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Boost investment</strong> from both Indian conglomerates and global automotive giants
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Integration with Other Policies {.wp-block-heading}

PLI is not a standalone initiative. It works alongside:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>FAME II</strong> – for demand-side incentives
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NEMMP</strong> – long-term EV vision
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>State EV policies</strong> – land, power, tax incentives
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Startup India</strong> – tax holidays and seed funding
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make in India</strong> – for duty waivers on equipment
  </li>
</ul>

Together, these create a full-stack policy ecosystem.
