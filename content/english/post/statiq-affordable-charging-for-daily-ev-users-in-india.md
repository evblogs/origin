Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer a futuristic concept in India—they&#8217;re here, and they’re gaining ground fast. But ask any EV owner about their biggest challenge, and most won’t mention battery life or vehicle cost. They’ll say: “Where do I charge easily, and without burning a hole in my wallet?”

That&#8217;s exactly the problem **Statiq** is solving.

While many EV infrastructure companies chase premium installations and highway fast-charging hubs, Statiq is focusing on the real everyday need—**affordable, reliable EV charging for daily Indian users**. This blog is a deep dive into how Statiq is quietly building one of the most user-centric EV charging networks in the country.

## Understanding the Problem: EV Adoption vs Charging Realities {.wp-block-heading}

India is pushing hard on electric mobility. The government is rolling out subsidies. Automakers are launching new EV models every quarter. And sales figures? They’re climbing.

But EV users in urban and semi-urban areas still face a major pain point—**practical, affordable charging infrastructure**. Most fast-charging stations are expensive and meant for long-distance travel. They aren’t ideal for daily users who just want to top up during work or shopping hours.

Imagine this: you own a Tata Nexon EV and commute 40–60 km daily. You don’t need a ₹25/kWh charger every day. You need something budget-friendly, nearby, and available when you need it.

That’s where Statiq shines.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Who Is Statiq? {.wp-block-heading}

Statiq is a Gurugram-based electric vehicle charging startup founded in 2020 by **Akshit Bansal** and **Raghav Arora**. While most companies entered the space with highway fast chargers in mind, Statiq took a different route—literally and strategically.

They focused on **urban and semi-urban hubs**, placing chargers where people live, work, and relax. Their target audience? Not luxury EV users—but the growing crowd of everyday EV owners using electric scooters, hatchbacks, and compact SUVs for daily transportation.

Their network today spans across **Delhi NCR, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Indore**, and several tier 2 and tier 3 cities—with thousands of charging points live and more being added every month.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## The Vision Behind Statiq’s Strategy {.wp-block-heading}

The idea wasn’t just to build a network—it was to build one that people would actually use every day.

Statiq asked the most fundamental question that often gets ignored in the EV ecosystem:  
**“How do we make charging affordable and accessible for regular users?”**

Their answer:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Place chargers in everyday locations: apartments, offices, cafes, malls, and hospitals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Offer both AC and DC chargers, depending on use case and budget.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep charging rates affordable—even if that means slower charging.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build a seamless app experience so users don’t waste time hunting for available chargers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner with local authorities, RWAs, and businesses to integrate chargers naturally into city life.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## The Cost Factor: Why Statiq is India’s Most Affordable Charging Option {.wp-block-heading}

Let’s get into what matters most to users—**money**.

In most Indian cities, the cost of charging an EV at a fast-charging station can range between ₹20–₹30 per kWh. This works out to ₹600–₹900 for a full charge for a vehicle like the Tata Nexon EV (30 kWh battery).

Statiq, in contrast, offers:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>AC charging</strong> at ₹12–₹18 per kWh
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DC charging</strong> at ₹18–₹22 per kWh in selected locations
  </li>
</ul>

So instead of paying ₹800 to fully charge your EV, you might end up paying ₹350–₹500 using Statiq. That’s a **40–60% saving**, and for users who charge multiple times a week, the monthly savings are significant.

If you&#8217;re running an electric scooter like the Ather 450X or Ola S1, the cost per charge is often under ₹50.

## Statiq’s App Experience: Charging Made Effortless {.wp-block-heading}

The Statiq mobile app is not just functional—it’s intuitive.

Many EV users avoid public charging because they don’t know which stations are available, how much they’ll be charged, or whether the plug will even work. Statiq addresses all of this with a simple, well-designed app.

**Key features of the Statiq App:**

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Real-time charger availability</strong>: No guesswork.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Slot reservation</strong>: Book your time in advance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Transparent pricing</strong>: See cost per kWh before charging.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multiple payment options</strong>: UPI, Paytm, Credit Card, Wallets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Charging progress tracker</strong>: Know how long until your battery is full.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Billing history</strong>: View your past sessions and costs.
  </li>
</ul>

It turns what could be a frustrating experience into a no-hassle routine.
