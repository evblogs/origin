# **Electric Vehicle Index: What I Learned, What You Should Know, and How It Can Help You Choose Smarter** {.wp-block-heading}

If you’ve ever tried to understand where the world is going with electric vehicles—or whether _you_ should jump in right now—you’ve probably felt overwhelmed.

I was in the same boat last year.

I’d been hearing a lot about EVs. Friends were switching to electric scooters, social media was flooded with EV launches, and even my mechanic told me I’d “regret not going electric.” But still, I wasn’t sure. Is the EV shift just hype? Or is it actually happening?

That’s when I came across something called the **Electric Vehicle Index**. At first, it sounded like a boring industry term. But trust me—it became the single most useful thing that helped me understand whether going electric made sense for _me_. And now, I want to break it down for _you_, like I would if we were sitting at a chai shop chatting about your next vehicle.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## So&#8230; What _Exactly_ Is the Electric Vehicle Index? {.wp-block-heading}

Think of it like this: imagine you had a scoreboard that told you how good each country is at switching to electric vehicles.

The **Electric Vehicle Index** does just that. It ranks countries (and sometimes even states) based on:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>How many EVs they’re selling?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How many they’re producing locally?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How well their charging infrastructure is growing?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How strong their battery supply chain is?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How much the government is helping people make the switch?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

It’s like checking the weather before planning a trek you don’t want to jump in blind. This index gives you a peek into whether the place you&#8217;re in (or planning to buy an EV in) is actually ready for it.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Why Should _You_ Even Care About an EV Index? {.wp-block-heading}

Let me be blunt: buying an electric vehicle isn’t like buying a regular petrol scooter or car. It comes with a few unique questions:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Will you find enough charging stations near your home or office?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Will your resale value hold up?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are you getting good government incentives or missing out on them?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Is the brand you’re choosing serious about after-sales support?</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

The EV Index answers _all_ of that by helping you zoom out and see what’s working in your region—or not.

When I was trying to decide between an EV and a petrol scooter, I checked how Maharashtra (where I live) was doing on EV adoption. Turns out, the government had introduced state subsidies and had installed hundreds of public chargers in Mumbai and Pune. Ola and Ather had strong service networks too. That was enough confidence for me to make the switch.

## Who’s Leading the EV Race? (And Why That Matters for You) {.wp-block-heading}

Here’s what I learned from following the EV Index data over the past year. These are the countries that are absolutely crushing it:<figure class="wp-block-table">

Why does this matter for you? Because the best practices, tech, and vehicle models from these countries _eventually shape what you get access to in India_. And sometimes, they drive price drops too.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Where Does India Stand Right Now? {.wp-block-heading}

If you’re thinking, “Okay, but what about India?”—I hear you. That was my exact thought too.

India is what experts call an _emerging player_ in the EV space. But let me tell you—there’s some exciting stuff happening here.

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>EVs now make up about 6% of total new vehicle sales</strong>. Two-wheelers are leading this growth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>State subsidies are making electric scooters cheaper than petrol ones</strong> in some regions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Charging stations have crossed 12,000</strong> nationwide—and growing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Local brands like Ola Electric, Ather, and Tata Motors are dominating</strong> the scene.
  </li>
</ul>

And with schemes like **FAME-II** and the **PLI (Production Linked Incentive)** for battery manufacturing, we’re not just importing—we’re building.

If you&#8217;re based in cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, or Hyderabad, you&#8217;re already in EV-ready zones. That means more charging options, better road support, and more resale demand.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## What Goes Into an EV Index {.wp-block-heading}

Let’s make this simple. These are the five things that usually make up a country’s EV Index score:

<ol class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>How many EVs are being sold?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How many are being made locally?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How many chargers are installed?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are batteries being produced at home or imported?</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Is the government helping or making it harder for buyers?</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Each of these tells you something useful. For instance, if EV sales are high but chargers are few, you might get stranded. If batteries are imported, prices may stay high. If local production is booming, service and support will likely be strong.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### So, What’s India’s EV Index Value Right Now? {.wp-block-heading}

**India’s Electric Vehicle Index can currently be considered as &#8220;Moderate with High Growth Potential.&#8221;**

Let me explain what that really means for you:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Sales are growing fast</strong>, especially in two-wheelers and three-wheelers, which is a great sign. You’re seeing more EVs on the road each month—and that means better social proof and better resale down the line.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Local manufacturing is scaling</strong>, thanks to companies like Tata Motors, Ola Electric, and Ather Energy. So, if you’re buying Indian-made, you’re actually helping push the index higher.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Charging infrastructure is improving</strong>, but it’s still uneven. If you’re in a metro, you’re good. Smaller cities? Still catching up.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Battery production is picking up</strong>, but we still import a significant chunk of lithium-ion materials. The more we build domestically, the more stable EV prices will get.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Government support is solid</strong>, but mostly at the state level. Some states offer amazing benefits (like Delhi and Maharashtra), while others are still getting started.
  </li>
</ul>

So, if you&#8217;re trying to decide whether India is &#8220;ready enough&#8221; for you to switch to an EV—the answer is: **Yes, especially in cities and for two-wheelers. But make sure you check your local infrastructure and policies first.**

In the next 2–3 years, I genuinely believe India will move from “moderate” to “strong” in this index—and you’ll be glad you were early.

## Here&#8217;s How the Index Helped Me Make a Better EV Decision {.wp-block-heading}

Let me share this honestly.

I was stuck between buying a petrol scooter that had proven reliability and an electric scooter from a new brand I wasn’t sure about. On paper, the EV was cheaper in the long run—but what if I couldn’t find a charger when I needed one?

So, I did what anyone would do: I googled. I found the latest Electric Vehicle Index updates. I saw that **Maharashtra had just launched new EV subsidies**, and that **Ola had expanded service centers nearby**. Ather had **installed fast chargers across my city**, and the EV sales numbers were climbing.

That gave me clarity.

I went ahead with an Ola S1 Pro. A year in, I’ve saved ₹20,000+ in petrol. I charge at home 90% of the time. And the few times I’ve needed help, the support team responded in a day.

The index didn’t just help me pick a scooter—it helped me _buy with confidence_.

## How You Can Use the Index to Your Advantage {.wp-block-heading}

Here’s how you can actually use this info, no matter who you are:

##### If You&#8217;re Thinking of Buying an EV: {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Look up your state’s EV policies (some offer big discounts).
  </li>
  <li>
    Check if your city has good charging coverage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare brands that are investing in your area (more service = less stress).
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask your dealership about government schemes and apply online—don’t miss out on subsidies!
  </li>
</ul>

##### If You’re Considering an EV Loan: {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Choose lenders that support EV financing (they often have better terms).
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the index to estimate resale value and total cost of ownership.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at Fincover.com to compare EV loan options side-by-side—you’d be surprised how much you can save.
  </li>
</ul>

##### If You’re Planning to Invest in EV Stocks: {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Use the EV Index to spot rising markets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Countries or companies moving up in the index usually get more funding, more media attention, and better long-term growth.
  </li>
</ul>
