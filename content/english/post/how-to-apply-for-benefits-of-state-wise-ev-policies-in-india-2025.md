India’s electric mobility journey is progressing quickly. While national schemes like FAME and PLI are making headlines, much of the real impact is happening at the **state level** — where governments are introducing their own electric vehicle (EV) policies to accelerate local adoption and support infrastructure.

Every Indian state has unique EV goals. Some are focusing on purchase subsidies, others on building charging networks, and a few are creating large EV industrial parks to boost manufacturing. Whether you’re planning to buy an EV or launch a business in the sector, understanding your **state&#8217;s EV policy** can save you a lot of money and help you plan better.

This guide will give you a complete overview of EV benefits by state, who qualifies, and how you can apply for these incentives.

## Why State EV Policies Matter {.wp-block-heading}

The central government lays down the big picture vision — but states are responsible for implementing and executing EV-friendly policies. Transportation, power, urban planning, land use, and local industrial development fall under state control.

Here&#8217;s how state policies help:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    They reduce the <strong>effective cost of EVs</strong> through purchase subsidies
  </li>
  <li>
    They remove <strong>road tax and registration charges</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    They offer <strong>capital support for charging stations</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    They provide <strong>subsidized electricity tariffs</strong> for EV-related infrastructure
  </li>
  <li>
    They allocate <strong>land and financial assistance</strong> to manufacturers and startups
  </li>
</ul>

If you&#8217;re serious about buying an EV or starting an EV business in India, your state’s policy is as important as the national schemes.

## Common Benefits Across States {.wp-block-heading}

While the exact numbers vary, most state EV policies include the following:

**Purchase Subsidy**  
A per kWh incentive on the battery capacity of the EV. Usually ₹5,000–₹10,000 per kWh for 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers.

**Scrappage Incentive**  
Extra benefits if the buyer scraps their old petrol or diesel vehicle.

**Road Tax and Registration Waiver**  
Most states offer 100% exemption on both charges for EVs.

**Charging Station Subsidy**  
Capital subsidy on equipment and civil work. Some states offer up to ₹10 lakh per public station.

**Electricity Tariff Discount**  
Special per-unit rates for EV chargers, usually lower than standard commercial rates.

**Manufacturing Support**  
Subsidies for factory setup, employment generation, land lease waivers, and GST refunds.
