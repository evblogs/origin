## **Introduction: India’s EV Push Needs Smart Charging** {.wp-block-heading}

India’s electric vehicle revolution is in full swing. From two-wheelers buzzing through traffic to electric buses gliding on city routes, the shift is unmistakable. But one major roadblock remains: reliable and accessible EV charging. That’s where **ElectricPe** steps in, aiming to change how India charges its electric vehicles—making it faster, smarter, and more affordable.

If you’re an EV owner or just considering the switch, this blog will give you a complete understanding of how ElectricPe is shaping the future of e-mobility in India.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## **Who Is ElectricPe? – The Brand Behind the Buzz** {.wp-block-heading}

Founded in 2021, **ElectricPe** is a Bengaluru-based EV charging platform on a mission to make clean mobility accessible to every Indian. Their approach is straightforward but ambitious: build the country’s **largest and most reliable EV charging network** by collaborating with existing infrastructure owners, like kirana stores, malls, apartments, fuel stations, and commercial complexes.

The company doesn’t believe in owning and building massive infrastructure from scratch. Instead, they smartly **aggregate and digitize** already existing power sources and locations—making them accessible to the EV public through one easy-to-use platform.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## **Founders’ Vision and Company Background** {.wp-block-heading}

ElectricPe was co-founded by **Avinash Sharma** (former Ola and Bounce exec) and **Rakesh Sharma**, with deep expertise in mobility, logistics, and energy. Their vision was clear: most Indians won’t switch to electric unless charging becomes as easy as filling petrol. They aimed to **bridge the &#8220;last-mile&#8221; charging gap** for urban EV users.

Under their leadership, ElectricPe has grown from a pilot project in Bangalore to a multi-city smart charging ecosystem trusted by thousands of EV riders.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## **Why ElectricPe Stands Out in India’s EV Landscape** {.wp-block-heading}

ElectricPe is not just another charging company. It’s building a **software-first solution** that makes EV charging:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Frictionless</strong> – Book, unlock, and pay for charging—all through one app.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Affordable</strong> – Dynamic pricing models ensure low cost for consumers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Distributed</strong> – Chargers are available not just at malls, but also in your street’s tea shop or apartment basement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data-Driven</strong> – Usage insights help optimize availability, pricing, and grid load.
  </li>
</ul>

This **asset-light model** means faster scaling and wider reach—especially in urban India where space is a constraint.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## **The ElectricPe App – How It Works and What It Offers** {.wp-block-heading}

At the heart of ElectricPe’s solution is its **mobile app**, available on Android and iOS. Here’s what the app offers:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Live Map of Nearby Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</strong><br />Whether you&#8217;re in Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai, just open the app and see all available Electric Vehicle Charging Stations with real-time availability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Station Booking & Access</strong><br />You can pre-book charging slots or simply walk-in and scan the QR code at the station.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cashless Payment Options</strong><br />UPI, credit/debit cards, wallets—everything is integrated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Charging Analytics</strong><br />Track your vehicle’s charging sessions, cost per kWh, and energy usage patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>In-App Support & Feedback</strong><br />Raise tickets, rate stations, and view live updates from the ElectricPe team.
  </li>
</ul>
