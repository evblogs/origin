### Introduction: From Petrol to Plug – Why This Project Matters {.wp-block-heading}

If you&#8217;re a college student in India with a knack for engineering, sustainability, or simply making things work, here&#8217;s a project that could define your resume: converting an old petrol scooter into a fully functional electric vehicle. Imagine taking that old, unused Activa or Scooty lying in your backyard and transforming it into a zero-emission ride. It&#8217;s not just cool—it’s practical, eco-friendly, and a smart way to learn about electric mobility from the inside out.

This blog will walk you through the entire process—from understanding the benefits to getting your hands dirty with tools and wires. Whether you&#8217;re planning this for your final-year project or just as a DIY weekend challenge with friends, you’ll find this guide packed with real advice, cost breakdowns, safety tips, and useful links to help you execute a conversion project that actually works on Indian roads.

### Why Convert a Petrol Scooter into an Electric Vehicle? {.wp-block-heading}

Petrol prices are rising, pollution is choking our cities, and the Indian government is pushing for clean energy mobility. Here’s why converting a scooter to electric makes perfect sense:

It cuts your running cost drastically. Charging a battery is far cheaper than filling a tank with petrol. On average, it costs about ₹0.25 to ₹0.50 per km with electricity, compared to ₹2–3 per km using petrol.

It offers a great hands-on learning experience with EV components such as motors, batteries, controllers, and charging systems. This knowledge is increasingly in demand.

It gives a second life to an old or unused vehicle. Instead of scrapping, you repurpose.

It aligns with India’s larger goals under the FAME II policy and electric mobility push.

It gives you an edge in college competitions, startup ideas, and academic research.

### Real-Life Student Case Studies {.wp-block-heading}

Many students across India have already built working prototypes or functional EVs from old scooters.

Students from VIT University converted a decade-old TVS Scooty into a functioning electric scooter using a 1000W hub motor, lithium battery pack, and a custom-designed controller enclosure. Their project went viral on LinkedIn.

A group from Chandigarh Engineering College used a retrofitting kit on a discarded Honda Activa and turned it into a campus shuttle. They managed to complete the project under ₹40,000.

An interdisciplinary team at IIT Bombay incorporated a GPS tracker and Arduino-controlled speed limiting system for added safety. They also filed for a student-level patent.

These are just a few inspiring examples proving that with proper planning and teamwork, you can achieve remarkable results as a student.

### Legal Requirements: Is It Allowed in India? {.wp-block-heading}

Yes, but you need to follow specific legal protocols.

As per Indian government norms, EV retrofitting is allowed but must be done using approved conversion kits. These kits are certified by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) or the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT).

You cannot legally drive a DIY EV on public roads unless you update your Registration Certificate (RC). You’ll need to:

Submit the kit certification papers and vehicle details to your Regional Transport Office (RTO). Get the converted vehicle inspected and certified. Update the fuel type on your RC book. Obtain new insurance and road tax documentation (if required). For campus or exhibition use, you don’t need registration, but it’s good practice to maintain safety and documentation.

### Tools and Components You&#8217;ll Need {.wp-block-heading}

To complete the project, you’ll need both mechanical tools and electric vehicle components.

### Step-by-Step Conversion Process {.wp-block-heading}

**1. Dismantling the Petrol Components:** Remove the engine, exhaust pipe, fuel tank, wiring harness, speedometer cable, and ignition system. Carefully disconnect and keep reusable parts.

**2. Mounting the Motor:** If using a hub motor, replace the rear wheel with the motorized one. For mid-drive motors, align and bolt to the central frame.

**3. Battery Placement:** Install the battery pack under the footboard or in the storage compartment. Ensure it’s mounted using brackets, cushioned with foam, and waterproofed.

**4. Controller Wiring:** Fix the controller near the motor or battery. Connect throttle, battery input, motor output, and auxiliary outputs. Label all wires to avoid confusion.

**5. DC Systems:** Use the DC-DC converter to step down power for horn, lights, and indicators. Connect it to the main battery line.

**6. Fuse Installation:** Place a fuse (rated 1.5x your motor current) between the battery and controller for safety.

**7. Testing and Debugging:** Before final enclosure, test the entire system on a stand. Check throttle response, brake switches, indicator lights, and voltage stability.

**8. Final Assembly:** Mount plastic covers, repaint the frame if needed, label switches, and do a slow-speed test in an open field.
