  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PLI Schemes:</strong> ₹18,000 crore for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) batteries
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GST Slashed:</strong> Only 5% GST on EVs and charging equipment
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>State EV Policies:</strong> Nearly every state offers benefits like interest-free loans, capital subsidies, and registration waivers
  </li>
</ul>

These initiatives have increased EV adoption rates even in non-metro areas. Electric vehicle business 2025 is likely to see more volume from tier 2 and tier 3 cities than ever before.
