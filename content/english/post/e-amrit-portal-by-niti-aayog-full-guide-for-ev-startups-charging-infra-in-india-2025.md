In the fast-growing world of electric vehicles (EVs), India is making waves. But as this green shift accelerates, many people still have basic questions: “Which EV should I buy?”, “Where can I charge it?”, or “How do I start an EV business in India?”

Enter **E-Amrit**, India’s most comprehensive government-backed platform dedicated to EV adoption.

Whether you’re a consumer considering your first electric scooter, a startup building an EV product, or a business setting up a charging station — the **E-Amrit Portal by NITI Aayog** is designed to help you take action with clarity and confidence.

In this guide, we’ll break down exactly how it works, what you can do with it, and how you can benefit from the portal — with real links, step-by-step actions, and plenty of practical tips.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## What Is the E-Amrit Portal? {.wp-block-heading}

**E-Amrit** stands for **Accelerated e-Mobility Revolution for India&#8217;s Transportation**.

Developed by **NITI Aayog** in collaboration with the UK Government, the portal was launched to offer a **single-window platform for everything EV** — from buying guides and subsidy updates to charger locators and business resources.

Its goal? To simplify the EV transition for **every stakeholder in the ecosystem** — including individuals, entrepreneurs, investors, and government agencies.

**Official Link:** <https://e-amrit.niti.gov.in>{.}

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Why Was E-Amrit Created? {.wp-block-heading}

Until recently, India’s EV ecosystem was a web of disconnected departments and outdated PDFs. People had to visit different websites for FAME subsidies, startup registrations, state EV policies, and charging infra guidelines. There was no central place to compare EV models or understand business opportunities.

NITI Aayog stepped in with E-Amrit to:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Simplify decision-making</strong> for EV users and startups
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encourage private sector participation</strong> by removing info gaps
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Centralize access to government support</strong> like PLI, FAME, and state schemes
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Empower small businesses, OEMs, and investors</strong> with verified data
  </li>
</ul>

E-Amrit is not just a website — it’s a digital backbone for India’s electric mobility future.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Who Should Use the E-Amrit Portal? {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Individuals</strong> looking to buy electric two-wheelers, cars, or autos

  <li>
    <strong>Fleet operators</strong> switching to electric delivery or taxi services

## Core Sections of the E-Amrit Portal (Explained in Detail) {.wp-block-heading}

Let’s explore what you’ll find on the E-Amrit website and how to make the most of each feature.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 1. EV Buying Guide {.wp-block-heading}

This is the most popular section for individuals. It lets you:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Compare EV models across <strong>2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, 4-wheelers</strong>, and <strong>buses</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    See detailed specs such as battery capacity, driving range, top speed, charging time
  </li>
  <li>
    View prices <strong>after subsidy deductions</strong> under FAME II or state schemes
  </li>
  <li>
    Access links to manufacturer websites or dealerships
  </li>
</ul>

For example, you can compare an **Ola S1 Pro** vs **TVS iQube** vs **Ather 450X** in one place, check who offers the best value, and estimate your monthly savings on fuel.

It removes guesswork from the EV buying decision.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 2. Charger Locator Tool {.wp-block-heading}

Many people worry about range or whether they’ll find chargers on the go. The Charger Locator Tool solves this.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    It maps <strong>nearby public EV charging stations</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Shows charger types: AC, DC, fast charging, slow charging
  </li>
  <li>
    Displays live status (in some cases), number of sockets, plug type
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrated with real-time data from Bharat Charge Alliance, NTPC, Tata Power, and private providers
  </li>
</ul>

Before your next intercity trip, you can map out charging stops along the route — all from the same page.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 3. Subsidy & Policy Dashboard {.wp-block-heading}

India has EV schemes at both central and state levels. But they’re scattered across dozens of government sites. The E-Amrit dashboard brings everything together.

It includes:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Details of FAME II subsidy</strong>, eligibility for 2W, 3W, 4W, and buses
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Production Linked Incentive (PLI)</strong> details for manufacturers and component makers
  </li>
  <li>
    A state-wise <strong>interactive map</strong> showing each state’s EV policy, benefits, and industry clusters
  </li>
</ul>

Want to know how much subsidy Maharashtra offers on an electric car? It’s right there. Want to compare Karnataka’s battery park incentives with Gujarat’s stamp duty waiver? This tool does that too.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 4. Total Cost of Ownership Calculator {.wp-block-heading}

Electric vehicles cost more upfront, but they save you money over time. The TCO calculator helps you:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Compare your fuel vehicle with an EV over a 5–7 year period
  </li>
  <li>
    Include factors like EMI, electricity rates, insurance, servicing
  </li>
  <li>
    See your breakeven point and long-term savings
  </li>
</ul>

It’s a practical tool that can turn a hesitant buyer into a confident EV user.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 5. EV Investment Opportunities {.wp-block-heading}

This section is pure gold for startups, investors, and B2B entrepreneurs.

You’ll find:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Information on land allotment for EV parks (like those in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Telangana)
  </li>

    Updates on FAME II tenders for buses, chargers, or battery tech
