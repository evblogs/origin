As India accelerates toward its electric mobility goals, the availability of fast, accessible, and affordable charging infrastructure is no longer optional — it&#8217;s critical. Recognizing this, the **Ministry of Power (MoP)** has released detailed **Charging Infrastructure Guidelines** to simplify the process of setting up EV charging stations and encourage widespread adoption.

If you&#8217;re a business owner, real estate developer, society resident, fleet operator, or even a petrol pump franchisee — these guidelines directly affect your ability to participate in India’s EV growth story.

This blog explains everything in clear terms — including how you can set up a charger, what benefits you&#8217;re entitled to, and how to apply for grid connections, approvals, and incentives in 2025.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## What Are the EV Charging Guidelines by the Ministry of Power? {.wp-block-heading}

These guidelines were introduced to:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Encourage public and private players</strong> to set up charging stations
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove regulatory bottlenecks
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure <strong>affordable, accessible EV charging infrastructure</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide <strong>single-window approval systems</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Offer <strong>tariff clarity</strong>, especially for commercial and public charging use
  </li>
</ul>

These MoP guidelines serve as the national framework under which **state electricity boards (DISCOMs), local municipalities, and urban planners** operate.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Key Highlights of the MoP Charging Infrastructure Guidelines (2023–2025) {.wp-block-heading}

Let’s decode each major provision in simple terms.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 1. No License Required for Setting Up Public Charging Stations {.wp-block-heading}

If you want to set up a public EV charging station, **you do not need a power distribution license**.

Under the Electricity Act, 2003 — any individual, company, or partnership can set up a public charging station **without needing approval from the electricity regulator**.

This means:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    No license
  </li>
  <li>
    No long delays
  </li>
  <li>
    Faster rollout
  </li>
</ul>

All you need is:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Land or space (owned or rented)
  </li>
  <li>
    Connection to the electricity grid
  </li>
  <li>
    Charger installation (Bharat/DC001, CCS2, CHAdeMO, etc.)
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 2. Timeline for DISCOM Connections {.wp-block-heading}

DISCOMs are now legally required to provide a new power connection for EV charging stations **within a fixed time frame**.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Urban Areas:</strong> 7 days
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Municipal Zones/Urban Extensions:</strong> 15 days
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rural Areas:</strong> 30 days
  </li>
</ul>

This clause is binding, and non-compliance can be escalated to the **State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC)**.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 3. Single Window Clearance System {.wp-block-heading}

All states and union territories must implement a **Single-Window Online Portal** for:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Registering as a public charging station
  </li>
  <li>
    Applying for electricity connection
  </li>
  <li>
    Accessing grid upgrade plans
  </li>
  <li>
    Viewing approved locations or sanctioned loads
  </li>
</ul>

This portal will be operated by DISCOMs and synchronized with **municipal building permissions**.

**Examples:**

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Delhi: <a class="" href="https://delhi.gov.in">https://delhi.gov.in</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Maharashtra: <a>https://maitri.mahaonline.gov.in</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 4. Time-of-Day (ToD) Tariffs {.wp-block-heading}

Charging stations are allowed to **purchase electricity at off-peak rates**, making charging cheaper during night hours.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Peak (6 PM to 10 PM): Higher rate
  </li>
  <li>
    Off-Peak (10 PM to 6 AM): Up to 30% lower rate
  </li>
</ul>

This encourages load balancing and helps save costs for charging station operators.

**Pro Tip:** You can pass on these savings to customers via night-time charging discounts.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 5. Public Charging Station Planning Guidelines {.wp-block-heading}

As per MoP recommendations:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    One charging station every <strong>3 km in cities</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    One fast charger every <strong>25 km on highways</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    One EV charging hub every <strong>100 km for heavy-duty vehicles</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

These are advisory goals, but states are aligning their EV masterplans accordingly.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 6. Support for Residential and Commercial Buildings {.wp-block-heading}

EV-ready infrastructure must now be part of building bye-laws. The MoP guidelines encourage:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Housing societies to reserve <strong>20% parking spaces</strong> for EV charging
  </li>
  <li>
    Malls, offices, and parking lots to offer <strong>dedicated EV charging bays</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    DISCOMs to offer <strong>domestic tariffs for private residential chargers</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

This means your society or office can set up an EV charger using the same electricity rate as your home.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 7. Support for Public Private Partnerships (PPP) {.wp-block-heading}

The government encourages **PPP models** in charging infrastructure. If you’re a private investor or startup:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    You can lease government land for charging stations
  </li>
  <li>
    Operate under a revenue-sharing agreement with municipal bodies
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit proposals through <strong>state-level EV agencies</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

### 8. Interconnection and Grid Upgrade Support {.wp-block-heading}

If a charging station requires a transformer upgrade or new substation, DISCOMs are required to:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Inform the applicant
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide time-bound estimates
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable <strong>shared infra</strong> where multiple operators use the same grid
  </li>
</ul>

Cost-sharing models will be based on actual usage over time.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Step-by-Step: How to Set Up an EV Charging Station in 2025 {.wp-block-heading}
