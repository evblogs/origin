India&#8217;s electric vehicle (EV) industry is picking up speed, and one name that keeps coming up when we talk about charging infrastructure is Tata Power. From powering homes for decades to now charging EVs across the country, Tata Power&#8217;s EZ Charge network is quietly building the backbone of India&#8217;s EV future. Whether you&#8217;re a daily commuter with a Nexon EV or planning an interstate trip in your MG ZS EV, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ve plugged into one of their chargers.

In this blog, let’s break down everything you need to know about Tata Power EZ Charge: what they offer for homes and highways, how they compare to competitors like ChargeZone and Ather Grid, and where they’re headed next.

## Tata Power EZ Charge: A Quick Snapshot {.wp-block-heading}

Tata Power&#8217;s EZ Charge platform is their end-to-end EV charging solution, offering both **home chargers** and a widespread **public charging network**. As of 2025, they&#8217;ve installed over **1.2 lakh home chargers** and **5,500+ public chargers** across **550+ cities and towns** in India. That makes them one of the largest charging networks in the country.

They provide two major types of chargers:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>AC Level 2 Chargers</strong> (usually 3.3 kW to 7.2 kW) for home and workplace use.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>DC Fast Chargers</strong> (ranging from 30 kW up to 150 kW or more) for public and highway locations.
  </li>
</ul>

Their network supports Type-2 connectors, CCS2 fast chargers, and older Bharat DC standards to ensure compatibility across most EV brands in India.

## Home Charging Made Easy {.wp-block-heading}

Tata Power&#8217;s home charger setup is smooth, especially if you&#8217;re buying a Tata Motors EV. Often, the dealership coordinates everything for you:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    A technician visits your house to inspect electrical load.
  </li>
  <li>
    If needed, they help you apply for load enhancement with the electricity board.
  </li>
  <li>
    Installation includes safety checks, proper earthing, and a wall-mounted charger.
  </li>
</ul>

For Tata Nexon EV buyers, a basic 3.3 kW charger is usually bundled for free or at a subsidized rate. If you want a faster 7.2 kW charger, you might pay around **₹50,000** including installation. In cities like Delhi, government subsidies can bring this down significantly.

Their home chargers are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, with RFID and OCPP support. While most users simply plug in overnight, you can monitor usage through the EZ Charge mobile app in select cases.
