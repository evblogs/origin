## **SCENE 1: The Petrol Price Shock** {.wp-block-heading}

It’s a hot afternoon, and you’re stuck at a red light. You glance at the fuel meter—empty.

&#8220;Didn’t I just fill the tank yesterday?&#8221;

Reluctantly, you turn towards the petrol pump. The queue is long, and people are shaking their heads at the display board.

Petrol price today: ₹110 per liter  
Full tank = ₹5,500 gone in seconds

You watch as a sleek electric car silently glides past. No engine noise, no fumes, no waiting at the pump.

Your friend smirks, &#8220;That’s an EV! One charge, 300 km, no tension!&#8221;

You pause for a second. &#8220;EV? What’s that?&#8221;

## **SCENE 2: What is an Electric Vehicle?** {.wp-block-heading}

An electric vehicle is a car that doesn’t need petrol or diesel. Instead, it runs on a battery—just like your smartphone. You plug it in at home or a charging station to &#8220;refuel.&#8221;

### **How Does It Work?** {.wp-block-heading}

Think of your mobile phone:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    You charge it overnight.
  </li>
  <li>
    It runs all day without needing a recharge.
  </li>
  <li>
    There’s no smoke, no fuel, no noise.
  </li>
</ul>

That’s exactly how an EV works. Instead of an engine, it has:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    A battery pack that stores electricity.
  </li>
  <li>
    An electric motor that converts battery power into movement—no gears, no clutch.
  </li>
  <li>
    A charging port where you plug it in at home or a charging station.
  </li>
  <li>
    A control system that manages battery power for efficient driving.
  </li>
</ul>

EVs don’t just save money, they make driving smoother and futuristic.

## **SCENE 3: Different Types of EVs in India** {.wp-block-heading}

Not all EVs are the same. Some run purely on electricity, while others have a petrol backup.<figure class="wp-block-table">

Which one is best for you?

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Want a 100% petrol-free experience? Go for a BEV.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need petrol backup for long trips? A PHEV might work.
  </li>
</ul>

## **SCENE 4: Why Are EVs Getting Popular in India?** {.wp-block-heading}

Five years ago, EVs were rare. Today, they are everywhere. Why?

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Petrol prices are rising. Petrol and diesel prices are unpredictable, while EV charging is cheaper and more stable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Government incentives. Buyers can get ₹1-2 lakh subsidies under the FAME II scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    Charging stations are growing. More EV charging stations are being installed across India at malls, offices, petrol pumps, and highways.
  </li>
  <li>
    EVs are environmentally friendly. Zero emissions mean cleaner air and less pollution.
  </li>
  <li>
    EV technology is improving. Faster charging, better range, and lower prices make EVs more practical than before.
  </li>
</ul>

So, if you’re tired of rising fuel costs, an EV is a smart switch.

And with government subsidies, prices can go even lower.
