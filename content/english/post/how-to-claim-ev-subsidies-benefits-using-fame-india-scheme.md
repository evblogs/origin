The future of mobility is electric, and India is accelerating that shift with the help of one of its most important initiatives: the FAME India Scheme. If you’ve been hearing the term &#8220;FAME&#8221; a lot and wondering what it actually means or how it impacts the EV ecosystem, this guide is for you.

Whether you’re planning to start an electric vehicle business, install charging stations, or simply want to understand how the government supports EV adoption, this detailed breakdown will help. We&#8217;ll explore the scheme&#8217;s objectives, who it benefits, how to apply, and what the future holds.

Let’s start with the basics.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## What is the FAME India Scheme? {.wp-block-heading}

FAME stands for **Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles**. It’s a government program launched by the **Ministry of Heavy Industries** in 2015. The primary aim is to promote the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in India by offering **financial incentives**, improving **charging infrastructure**, and encouraging **local manufacturing**.

This scheme is part of a larger vision laid out under the **National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP)**.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Why Was the FAME Scheme Introduced? {.wp-block-heading}

India has several challenges when it comes to transport:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    High dependence on imported crude oil
  </li>
  <li>
    Growing air pollution in urban areas
  </li>
  <li>
    Rising carbon emissions from the transport sector
  </li>
  <li>
    Increasing demand for sustainable public transport
  </li>
</ul>

To address these issues, FAME aims to push both the **supply** and **demand** sides of the EV ecosystem.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

## Phases of the FAME India Scheme {.wp-block-heading}

### Phase I (2015 – 2019) {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Total outlay: Rs. 895 crore
  </li>
  <li>
    Focused on pilot projects
  </li>
  <li>
    Targeted electric 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, 4-wheelers, and buses
  </li>
  <li>
    Supported 2.8 lakh vehicles
  </li>
  <li>
    Laid the groundwork for infrastructure and policy-making
  </li>
</ul>

### Phase II (2019 – March 2024) {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Outlay: Rs. 10,000 crore
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus: Scaling adoption for commercial use, charging infrastructure, and electric buses
  </li>
  <li>
    Supports: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        7,000 electric buses
      </li>
      <li>
        5 lakh electric 3-wheelers
      </li>

      <li>
        10 lakh electric 2-wheelers
