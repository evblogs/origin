      <description>&lt;p&gt;Electric cars are only as good as the battery they carry – it’s the &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt; of the vehicle. The battery determines how far you can go, how fast you charge, how long the car lasts, and even how safe your ride is. In fact, one EV expert notes that “one of the most important parts of an electric vehicle is the battery system”​&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.byd.com/eu/blog/BYDs-revolutionary-Blade-Battery-all-you-need-to-know#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20important,as%20increased%20battery%20space%20utilisation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;byd.com&lt;/a&gt;. For new EV buyers in India, understanding battery technology can feel overwhelming. But it really boils down to having a battery that is safe, long-lasting, high-range, and cost-effective. That’s where &lt;em&gt;blade battery technology&lt;/em&gt; comes in – a game-changing design that BYD has pioneered to meet these exact needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to buying an electric vehicle (EV) in India, most people look at price, range, brand, or features. But very few pay attention to something even more important—the &lt;strong&gt;type of battery&lt;/strong&gt; inside the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
